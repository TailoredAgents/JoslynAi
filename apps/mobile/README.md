## Joslyn AI Mobile Preview

The native app is an early staged shell while we collect feedback. The production experience lives on the web at [https://joslyn.ai](https://joslyn.ai) today.

### Current status

- âœ… Expo project boots and displays a roadmap message.
- ðŸš§ Feature work (chat, document intake, notifications) still in design.
- âœ… Linking shortcuts let users jump to the full web workspace.

If you are interested in piloting the native experience, email `hello@joslyn.ai` and we will add you to the beta list.
